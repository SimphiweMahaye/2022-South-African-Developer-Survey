A 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey with a focus on South Africa.

I remember hearing about Big Data, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and how it was revolutionising, not just the Information Technology fields, but each and every industry you could imagine! from Farming all the way to Manufacturing. So as a "Tech Geek" I couldn't wait to get my hands dirty and dig deep into this fascinating new field thatâ€™s taking the world by storm, I just couldn't be left behind!

But you could imagine my utter shock when, not only was there no cohesive article, study, YouTube video or even university prospectus that comprehensively covered or told you which way to go about being a "Data Professional", all the sources I got recommended seemed to contradict themselves. every article I read would suggest a different path, a different programming language to start with a different database, heck! even a different profession all together! It was an absolute nightmare!

The myriad of contradictory information didn't help in explaining this new profession at all! In fact it made it even more confusing!

Until I came across a dataset on 'Stack Overflow' aptly named the 'Developer Survey'. a Survey with upwards of 70 000 professional respondents answering questions such as: Which programming language, database platform, cloud platform are you currently using? What is your annual salary? What is your age, gender, etc ?

It was the perfect dataset to set me on the right track, it would guarantee that I only focused on the most popular technologies. and it would also give me a direct path in filtering out all the arbitrary courses and focus mainly on the ones that would guarantee me greater success at entering the field.

But! the dataset had one problem, although it was a global survey, conducted all over the world on a lot of countries, the visualisations and analyses only focused on the United States. I needed my data to be specifically based on South Africa.

So, I sought out to make that my mission.
